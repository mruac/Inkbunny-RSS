# Inkbunny-RSS

My first proper project, inspired by the RSS function in [boothale's FurAffinity API "FAExport"](https://github.com/boothale/faexport)

Essentially it takes the output from Inkbunny's search API and converts it into a usable RSS file that can be used locally. Please refer to InkBunny's API [documentation](https://wiki.inkbunny.net/wiki/API#Search) for more information and possible flags.
